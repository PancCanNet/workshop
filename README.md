# PancCanNet workshop

## Workshop 2: Analysis workflows

_Date_: 9 September 2021<br/>
_Organizer_: Martina Summer-Kutmon

**Preparation**<br/>
Follow the [installation instruction](Installation.md) to make sure you have all required software installed.

**Description**<br/>
In this workshop, we will use the developed PancCanNet workflows to showcase how to analyse molecular data using the pathway knowledge in WikiPathways and the PancCanNet community portal. The aim is to provide more detailed information about the molecular mechanisms and support interpretation with advanced visualizations.
